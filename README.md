# Hi there, I'm Casey üëã

## üöÄ About Me
I'm a passionate Software Engineer from Boise, ID.
I really enjoy programming and software development, specifically in the domain of CyberSecurity.

I attended Boise State University and graduated with my B.S. in Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile (GIMM) in December 2021.
In my time at Boise State, I worked on the GIMM development team where I developed multiple applications. (More about those below!)
Currently, I work as a Software Engineer full-time and I am working on personal projects and software consulting after work.

My primary side project at the moment is called Keystroke Dynamics. The purpose is to improve Identity security with ML, by training the model to identify
the user by subconscious habits with their typing and session data - Without the use of personally identifiable information (PII)

When I need a break from the stress of coding, I love to learn more about all sorts of technology and spend time with my family.

## üõ† Skills
C# ASP.NET, Linux, Penetration Testing, Security Audits, Cloud Architecture, Python

Additionally, I have applicable project experience with:
Python,
HTML/CSS/JS,
NextJS,
Go.

üå± I am someone who strives to learn the core fundamentals of programs, and I am able to pick up new languages quickly.
Currently, I am developing skills in C-programming and Rust to gain a better understanding of operating systems and functional programming design.

# ABC Stories ‚úè
An Augmented Reality Game to teach kids handwriting. An award-winning application.

Our team was challenged to design an application to help children with Autism learn English handwriting. I spent a lot of time researching Autism and applying that knowledge to design gameplay that turned out to have a profound impact on them, as well as neurotypical students. Designing the system to include solutions for positive reinforcement learning, proper hand posture, and identifying areas that required additional focus and repetitions.

While on this project, I spearheaded the development of the partner website abcstories.org[https://abcstories.org/]
- Website Deployment - AWS EC2 server of a monolith architecture website, NodeJS, load balancing, and security groups.
- Authentication/Authorization, for parents and teachers to log in and see a list of children who they have authority to access.
- Applied Systems to prevent XSS and Injection attacks
- Created and configured a Firebase NoSQL database for storing student progress.
- Audited and adjusted for FERPA Compliance
- Backend System design for our data dashboard. Identifying key metrics of student performance and providing an API for our website to display the data.

More project descriptions coming soon...

# Jane Public API
A public-facing API for Sellers to manage e-commerce listings, orders, and shipping information. Acting as a proxy for internal microservices and third-party integrations.

# ChatterQuant data dashboard
A contract development gig where I created a NextJS data dashboard with Tradingview widgets.

# Allinfavor.org
An interactive app for classroom participation. System design inspired by Jackbox games, allowing students to participate in classroom discussion via their phones and a room code on the website.

# Keystroke Dynamics
A SaaS product providing ML identity detection with machine learning.
