## What I Do

- Build internal developer platforms that standardize delivery at scale
- Design secure, policy-driven CI/CD systems with enforced quality gates
- Modernize legacy .NET workloads into containerized services
- Enforce supply chain integrity (SLSA, SBOM, artifact provenance)
- Implement multi-agent development workflows with human-in-the-loop control

## Philosophy

Platforms should:

- Reduce cognitive load  
- Encode standards as automation  
- Make the secure path the easy path  
- Scale without increasing coordination cost

> I build platforms that let engineers — and agents — move fast, safely.
