# ABC Stories ‚úè
An Augmented Reality Game to teach kids handwriting. An award-winning application.

Our team was challenged to design an application to help children with Autism learn English handwriting. I spent a lot of time researching Autism and applying that knowledge to design gameplay that turned out to have a profound impact on them, as well as neurotypical students. Designing the system to include solutions for positive reinforcement learning, proper hand posture, and identifying areas that required additional focus and repetitions.

While on this project, I spearheaded the development of the partner website abcstories.org[https://abcstories.org/]
- Website Deployment - AWS EC2 server of a monolith architecture website, NodeJS, load balancing, and security groups.
- Authentication/Authorization, for parents and teachers to log in and see a list of children who they have authority to access.
- Applied Systems to prevent XSS and Injection attacks
- Created and configured a Firebase NoSQL database for storing student progress.
- Audited and adjusted for FERPA Compliance
- Backend System design for our data dashboard. Identifying key metrics of student performance and providing an API for our website to display the data.
